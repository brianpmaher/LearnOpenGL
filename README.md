# Learn OpenGL

This repository is a collection of my own example applications and notes for learning OpenGL.

I've picked up a little bit of graphics programming in the past, but this year, I'm setting out formally learn more about graphics programming and get into some more advanced graphics programming techniques.

## Project Setup and Requirements

This project has a few requirements that are up to you to source:

- A desktop platform that supports OpenGL 3.3
- A C++ compiler with C++20 language standard support
- [CMAke](https://cmake.org/)

Each example is a separate application. See [CmakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt) for a list of example applications.

## Dev Log

### 2025-01-24

I'm home sick today with the flu. My mind is pretty foggy, but I've slept enough and have nothing else to do, so decided I might as well use today to kick this off.

I setup a C++ project with CMake and clang-format for some consistency and Setup a basic HelloWorld example to make sure that my build system works.
