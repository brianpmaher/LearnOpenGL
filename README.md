# Learn OpenGL

This repository is a collection of my own example applications for learning OpenGL.

I've picked up a little bit of graphics programming in the past, but this year, I'm setting out formally learn more about graphics programming and get into some more advanced graphics programming techniques.

## Resources

- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)
- [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/)
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/documentation.html)

## Project Setup

This project has a few requirements that are up to you to source:

- A desktop platform that supports OpenGL 3.3
- A C++ compiler with C++20 language standard support
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

Each example is a separate application. See [CmakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt) for a list of example applications.

This project was developed and tested to work on Windows. It likely doesn't work on other platforms without some additional work.
